# Cloud cover statistical analysis to find out which town has better chances of clear skies - Flisa or Horn

This analysis was a part of a bigger project. In the preparation phase, we needed to choose between several locations, two of them being Flisa in Norway and Horn in Sweden. Cloud cover was one of the important factors. We needed to determine which location provided a better chance of low cloud coverage in the hours around noon. I found it to be a fun little statistical exercise. 

The Jupyter Notebook contains both the code and the analysis and should be self explanatory.
